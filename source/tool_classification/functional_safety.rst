**Tool Classification**

According to ISO-26262 Part 8, in safety-related usage scenarios, Pulsar2 anomalies will introduce errors in product safety factors (TI2), and the confidence level of prevention and detection of anomalies and errors is low (TD3). Therefore, the confidence level of Pulsar2 is assessed as TCL3.

**Functional safety compliance**

The qualification of Pulsar2's software tools is mainly based on the "1c software tool confirmation" method. The test suite-based tests cover the complete tool requirements and provide evidence that tool errors will not occur or will be detected. There is also a corresponding handling manual for software tool functional anomalies. In addition, Pulsar2 has been used for more than 2 years and is used in multiple customer projects.
At the same time, Pulsar2 has successfully passed the functional safety certification of a third-party authoritative certification body.
Therefore, when following the user manual, Pulsar2 can be used to develop models with safety requirements up to ASIL-D.
